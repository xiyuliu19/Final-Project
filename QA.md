Issues:
1. Need to clarify that all commands are run in the git cloned directory.
2. Need to add --user at the end of command "python setup.py install"

Thank you for the kindly peer review by Eric. I have added the git clone process for MSIpred in my R notebook. What's more, I have added --user in the command line for installing MSIpred packages. So, I have reached Beta.
